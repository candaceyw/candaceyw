### Hi, I'm Candace! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a web developer and designer.

I'm an ambitious, seasoned graphic designer and developer with over 17 years of experience in design. While I have a strong eye for design, I also love learning new skills that keep me challenged. HTML, CSS (SASS and LESS), JavaScript, React, React-Redux, Node, SQL, Python has opened up opportunities for me to build out my ideas from design to development.

I'm currently learning PHP
